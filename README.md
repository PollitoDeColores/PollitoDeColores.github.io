Academic version of the Rotary Engine Parts and Functioning (interactive visualization).
Currently the animations have some Visual bugs listed below. But since the project is for academic purpouses I will let it slide this time.
Note: I know is not right to let that kind of bugs just unsolved, but I repeat, since is an academic work, the important part is the "Interactive data visualization", not the animation.
But obviously if we're talking about another environment (like a professional work, or a comission), that bugs must be solved before the product could be shown to the customer/public.

Animation Bugs:
1. While tearing the engine apart, some parts just pass through others, like ghosts.
2. While removing the cap of the engine, both the cap and the gasket pass through the axis, it looks pretty odd.
3. There's no animation for putting the cap back on (I know it's not a bug, but is important to note this, since it was a planning error at the moment of making the animations)
4. When any animation starts, theres an odd jump between the end of the animation and the static frame where the info is shown.
5. When the first stroke is reproducing, theres an odd jump between the static frame and the moving animation.
6. When the idling animation is being played, sometimes the rotor does a little odd jump in any random frame, this is not as common as you could think.
